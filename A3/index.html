data-ob="43"> And in this aggregate memory of who knows how many nights over <a data-o="44">the course of</a><span data-ob="44">, <a data-o="45">god</a></span><span data-ob="45">, it’s upsetting even to guess <a data-o="46" data-c="46">how many years</a></span><span data-ob="43" data-cb="46">…</span><span data-ob="46">, what I think of is <a data-o="51">the two of us</a>.</span></span><span data-ob="51"> Though we’re not sitting <a data-o="60">beside each other</a><span data-ob="60">,  maybe <a data-o="61">we’re</a> even at opposite ends of the table</span>.</span><span data-ob="61"> But <a data-o="78" data-c="78" data-cb="62">something</a><span data-ob="62"><a data-o="64">something</a></span> has <a data-o="62" data-c="62" data-cb="78">been said</a><span data-ob="78"><a

political allegiance went, there was a time when it would hardly have occurred to us <a data-o="178">to wonder</a> which side the birds were on<span data-ob="178"> but <a data-o="179">if it had</a><span data-ob="179">, or if we had been asked</span>, the answer would <a data-o="180">have been obvious</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="180"> <a data-o="181">What did we know</a> in those days?</span><span data-ob="181"> We knew that <a data-o="182">the crops grew tall</a> for the glory of the nation<span data-ob="182">, that <a data-o="183">the sun rose to light our way</a></span><span data-ob="183">, that the swaddling seas <a data-o="184">protected us</a> from aggressors and parasites</span>.</span><span data-ob="184"> And if asked to say <a data-o="185" data-c="185">on whose side the birds stood</a><span data-ob="184" data-cb="185">..</span><span data-ob="185">, we would have said that they too seemed a part of <a data-o="186">the natural glory of our country</a></span><span data-ob="186">: they <a data-o="187">could only be with us</a></span>. </span></p><p><span data-ob="187"><a data-o="188">There was</a><span data-ob="188">, after all,</span> extremely <a data-o="189">good evidence</a> in their favour.</span><span data-ob="189"> Since they were in our country but not in prison, they were <a data-o="190">friendly to our cause</a><span data-ob="190"> and wholeheartedly <a data-o="191">opposed to the enemy’s</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="191"> Their freedom was absolute <a data-o="192">proof of their innocence</a><span data-ob="192">, as the arrest of even a previously well thought-of neighbour was <a data-o="193">proof of their guilt</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="193">And <a data-o="194">if it could be shown</a><span data-ob="194">, as it apparently could,</span> that the birds spent a portion of the year <a data-o="195" data-c="195">in the land of our enemy</a><span data-ob="193" data-cb="195">..</span><span data-ob="195">, then it could only be the case that they travelled there <a data-o="196">to spy on our behalf</a></span><span data-ob="196">, that while there they <a data-o="197">sowed dissent</a></span><span data-ob="197"> or gathered information <a data-o="198">for our use</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="198"> Because how else could they be allowed <a data-o="199">to come and go so freely</a>?</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="199"><span data-ob="199">Still, <a data-o="200">suspicion did fall on the birds</a><span data-ob="200">, but <a data-o="201">not abruptly</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="201"> <a data-o="202">Long before</a>, <span data-ob="202">as our desire for equality became serious,</span> we went to some of those who had greater power and <span data-ob="203">much </span><a data-o="203">more money</a> <a data-o="204">than we did</a><span data-ob="204">, and we demanded that these things be <a data-o="205">more evenly dispersed</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="205">  To begin with <a data-o="206">they resisted</a><span data-ob="206"> <a data-o="207">saying</a><span data-ob="207">, as they had always said,</span> that they had <a data-o="208">worked hard for these things</a> and deserved them</span>.</span><span data-ob="208"> They had accrued their wealth and power <a data-o="210">by the sweat of their brow</a><span data-ob="210"> and <a data-o="211">their superior natural attributes</a></span><span data-ob="211">, and in a world in which effort and ability <a data-o="209">were unequal</a><span data-ob="209">, as they evidently were,</span> true fairness <a data-o="212">rewarded individuals accordingly</a></span>. </span></p><p><span data-ob="212">This time <a data-o="213">we were not dissuaded</a>.</span><span data-ob="213"> We <a data-o="214">argued</a> with them. </span><span data-ob="214"> We pointed out how much of <a data-o="215">the wealth and power</a> was inherited<span data-ob="215">, and all of the mechanisms they had devised to preserve that wealth and power for <a data-o="216">their beautiful children</a></span><span data-ob="216">, at the inevitable expense of <a data-o="217">our rather less beautiful children</a></span><span data-ob="217">, some of whom had shabby clothes and suffered from <a data-o="218">stress-related Irritable Bowel Syndrome</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="218"> We pointed out that even the natural attributes that enabled them to succeed so abundantly were not things <a data-o="219">that they had chosen</a><span data-ob="219">, but <a data-o="220">gifts</a> they were lucky enough to have received</span>.</span><span data-ob="220"> Their intelligence, their business sense, even their capacity for brow sweat had come from a combination of <a data-o="221">circumstance and genetics</a><span data-ob="221"> <a data-o="222">in which they had no say</a></span>.  </span><span data-ob="222"> You’re down here in this deterministic universe <a data-o="223">with the rest of us</a><span data-ob="223">, <a data-o="224">we said</a></span><span data-ob="224">, and we put something of the sort onto <a data-o="225">placards</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="225"> (Though many of us found the phrase clunky and made placards with <a data-o="226">our own slogans</a><span data-ob="226"> that were <a data-o="227">pithier</a></span><span data-ob="227">, but perhaps risked diluting <a data-o="228">our message</a></span>.)</span></p><p><span data-ob="228">The rich and powerful pecked at <a data-o="229">the issue of determinism</a><span data-ob="229">, trying unsuccessfully to muddy the issue with talk of <a data-o="230">quantum physics</a></span><span data-ob="230">, <a data-o="231">retro-causality and true randomness</a></span><span data-ob="231">, but again <a data-o="232">we stayed firm</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="232"> We pointed out that no randomness or uncertainty embedded their success in <a data-o="233">any extra-natural ‘them’</a><span data-ob="233"> who had created their positive attributes <a data-o="234"><em>ex nihilo</em></a></span><span data-ob="234"> and thereby earned them <a data-o="235">power and a great deal of money</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="235"> We also made clear that the <a data-o="236">talking-things-through-and-making-placards</a> part of the proceedings could only continue for a limited time<span data-ob="236"> before we moved on to the bloodletting and the <a data-o="237">beautiful-children-clogging-the-gutters-of-the-streets</a> part of the proceedings</span>.</span><span data-ob="237"> <a data-o="238">And</a><span data-ob="238">, in fairness to them,</span> they took this point and <a data-o="239" data-c="239">promised to return to us</a> with real, substantive thoughts on how greater equality <a data-o="240">could be achieved</a><span data-ob="240"> in solidarity with one another</span>.</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="239"><span data-ob="239">At times, while they discussed the matter among themselves, we would stand in the sight lines of their <a data-o="245">mansions</a><span data-ob="245">, <a data-o="246">offices</a></span><span data-ob="246">, <a data-o="247">restaurants</a></span><span data-ob="247">, <a

data-o="253">a guillotine</a></span><span data-ob="253">, <a data-o="254">say</a></span><span data-ob="254">, or spend an afternoon pointedly <a data-o="255">sharpening our axes</a></span><span data-ob="255">, or we might hold up <a data-o="256">photographs of their sleeping children</a></span><span data-ob="256"> <a data-o="257">taken through a telephoto lens</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="257"> In this way we hoped <a data-o="258">to focus their minds</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="258">When we finally met again, they <a data-o="259">very graciously</a> refrained from mentioning this behaviour.</span><span data-ob="259">  They were civil and eager to agree <a data-o="260">concrete plans</a> for how best to achieve our common goals. </span><span data-ob="260">And, it became clear that their thinking on what true equality would mean was subtler and grander than anything we had succeeded <a data-o="241">in fumbling towards</a><span data-ob="241"> with our own, <a data-o="242">more restricted abilities</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="242"> So, while many of us began with doubts about their commitment to fairness, those doubts <a data-o="243">should have been</a> <span data-ob="243">(and largely were) </span>quickly erased by <a data-o="244">the ambition of their plans</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="244">The world, they <a data-o="262">had come to realise</a><span data-ob="262"> – <a data-o="263">from our conversations</a></span><span data-ob="263">  and from those times we had stood near their windows readying instruments of death</span><span data-ob="262"> – </span> was <a data-o="264">a pitiful morass of inequity</a>.</span><span data-ob="264"> To avoid being sucked into despair we would have <a data-o="265">to concentrate</a><span data-ob="265">, <a data-o="266">to aim our attention</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="266"> As a person <a data-o="280" data-c="280">wanting to strike a match</a> must draw it sharply in a single direction<span data-ob="266" data-cb="280">..</span><span data-ob="280">, so for our revolution to catch would require us to <a data-o="267">begin at a single point</a> in the expanse of all that was

data-ob="269"> and <a data-o="270">they expressed it</a> with a great deal of eloquence</span>. </span><span data-ob="270"> Where, we wanted to know, <a data-o="271">should we start</a>?</span><span

birds</a>.</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="309"><span data-ob="309">We <a data-o="310">looked at the birds</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="310">There were chickens in their <a data-o="311">hundreds of thousands</a><span data-ob="311"> crammed into wire cages not much larger than <a data-o="312">the chickens themselves</a></span><span data-ob="312">, each one <a data-o="313">pressed into position</a> like a fuse into the heart of a machine</span>.</span><span data-ob="313"> On the very first day of their lives they had been <a data-o="314">debeaked and injected</a><span data-ob="314">, the start of a medical regime designed to adhere them to a life of unremitting <a data-o="315">darkness and squalor</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="315">  Sometimes, they developed <a data-o="316">a madness</a><span data-ob="316"> that would cause them to peck violently at the vent in their own flesh from which they <a data-o="317">industrially birthed</a> egg upon egg upon egg</span>.</span><span data-ob="317"> <a data-o="318">Chronic pain</a><span data-ob="318">, <a data-o="319">cannibalism</a></span><span data-ob="319">, <a data-o="320" data-c="320">group starvation to promote laying</a></span><span data-ob="317" data-cb="320">..</span><span data-ob="320">: these things were <a data-o="321">not uncommon</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="321"> These birds seemed to us to be <a data-o="322">heroes</a><span data-ob="322">, enduring <a data-o="323">unimaginable suffering</a> for the people of the country that they loved</span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="323">Then there were <a data-o="324">pet birds</a>.</span><span data-ob="324"> They contributed <a data-o="325">in their own way</a> to the public good<span data-ob="325"> through the <a data-o="326">happiness</a> that they brought to their owners</span>.</span><span data-ob="326"> <a data-o="327">Their sacrifice</a>, though, was much smaller than that of the chickens.</span><span data-ob="327"> It was true that they had <a data-o="328">given up their freedom</a><span data-ob="328">, and in some cases <a data-o="329">the freedom they might have enjoyed uncaged</a> was considerable</span><span data-ob="329">, but they were <a data-o="330">well cared for</a></span><span data-ob="330">, they were <a data-o="331">loved and kept healthy</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="331"> It would have embarrassed any sensible, decent pet bird to have their obligations <a data-o="332">compared to that of a chicken</a>.</span><span data-ob="332"> The chicken, noble and selfless, endured <a data-o="333">an incredible tax on its existence</a><span data-ob="333">, a tax more substantial than any <a data-o="334">merely financial tax</a></span><span data-ob="334"> levied <a data-o="335">on any person</a> who ever lived</span>.</span><span data-ob="335"> The pet birds, on the other hand, received a great deal of <a data-o="336">preferential treatment</a><span data-ob="336"> for what were <a data-o="337">extremely minor responsibilities</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="337">And there were the <a

data-ob="341">, <a data-o="342">kestrels</a></span><span data-ob="342">, <a data-o="343">pigeons</a></span><span data-ob="343">, <a data-o="344">sparrows</a></span><span data-ob="344">, <a

benefits</a> of living in an advanced society such as ours</span>.</span><span data-ob="350"> <a data-o="351">What</a> did they contribute in return?</span><span data-ob="351"> <a data-o="352">Nothing</a>.</span><span data-ob="352"> Only certain <a data-o="353">ineffable, accidental contributions</a> to a well-functioning ecosystem<span data-ob="353"> and perhaps to the <a data-o="354">decoration</a> of an aesthetically pleasing sky</span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="354">It gave us <a data-o="355">a lot to think about</a><span data-ob="355">, this business with <a data-o="356">the chickens</a></span><span data-ob="356"> and <a data-o="357">the budgerigars, canaries and parrots</a></span><span data-ob="357">, and <a data-o="358">the swans, gulls, terns, tits, cranes, geese, sparrows, goshawks, pigeons, house martins and swallows</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="358"> The wealthy and powerful suggested that <a data-o="359">a good first step</a> would be to establish a commission<span data-ob="359"> that could properly <a data-o="360">investigate</a></span><span data-ob="360"> and then provide <a data-o="361">a comprehensive report on the birds</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="361">But at the very least, <a data-o="362">the injustice was striking</a>.</span><span data-ob="362"> Even though the chicken was suited <a data-o="363">to its sacrifice</a> in a way the other birds could not be<span data-ob="363">, no discrepancy of so startling a degree <a data-o="364">could be tolerated</a></span><span data-ob="364"> in a country intent on <a data-o="365">the pursuit of equality</a></span>.</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="365"><span data-ob="365"><a data-o="366">Several things happened next</a>.</span><span data-ob="366"> A committee was formed and began <a data-o="367">the long process</a> of evidence gathering.</span><span data-ob="367"> Meanwhile, some obnoxious elements on our side regrettably wasted time <a data-o="368">criticising the talk of the birds</a><span data-ob="368">, which they mischaracterised as <a data-o="369">a sideshow</a></span><span data-ob="369">, <a data-o="370">a distraction</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="370"> In response, <a data-o="371">the wealthy and powerful</a><span data-ob="371">, full of ardour for a fairer society,</span> suggested some <a data-o="372">sensible and temporary</a> changes to the law<span data-ob="372"> – measures that would allow <a data-o="373">any chatter</a> <span data-ob="373">(that might otherwise derail us) </span>to be <a data-o="374">dealt with quickly and efficiently</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="374">We of course <a data-o="375">promptly agreed</a> to these changes<span data-ob="375">: this was self-evidently an <a data-o="376">extraordinary, unprecedented</a> period in the history of our country</span><span data-ob="376">and it made sense that <a data-o="377">extraordinary</a><span data-ob="377"> (and only very temporary)</span> measures <a data-o="378">would be required</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="378"> Using these new powers, the wealthy saw that some token arrests were made and <a data-o="379">the backchat quickly abated</a>.</span><span data-ob="379"> Our time was freed to address <a data-o="380">the quandary of the birds</a><span data-ob="380">, and how they could be <a data-o="381">more equitably taxed</a></span>. </span></p><p><span data-ob="381">One Member of Parliament made a speech suggesting that the life of the chickens <a data-o="382">might be made easier</a>.</span><span data-ob="382"> They could be allowed access <a data-o="383">to sunlight and to outside space</a>.</span><span data-ob="383"> This would, in turn, make them less prone <a data-o="384">to excessive pecking at each other and themselves</a><span data-ob="384">, which would make it <a data-o="385">unnecessary to shear their beaks</a> with a heated blade</span>.</span><span data-ob="385"> With some freedom of movement and a higher quality of life, they <a data-o="386">would move closer to the superior existence of the pet birds</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="386"> We were <a data-o="387">momentarily moved by the MP</a><span data-ob="387">, but <a data-o="388">the wealthy and powerful</a><span data-ob="388">, together with the media,</span> reminded us that this MP was <a data-o="389">an idealist</a></span><span data-ob="389"> and pointed out how <a data-o="390">laughable</a> his speech and opinion were</span>.</span><span data-ob="390"> The production of eggs was necessary and the only way to secure them in sufficient quantity was by following <a data-o="391">tried and tested methods</a><span data-ob="391">: the extreme limiting of movement and light for the birds, and <a data-o="392">all else</a> that these things entailed</span>.</span><span data-ob="392"> If there were ways to alleviate the suffering of the chickens, then <a data-o="393" data-c="393">they would of course</a> happily see them done<span data-ob="392" data-cb="393">!</span><span data-ob="393">, but, in the real world, <a data-o="394">to unburden the chickens was quite impossible</a>.</span></span></p><p><span data-ob="394"><a data-o="395">There was also</a><span data-ob="395">, they pointed out,</span> an <a data-o="396">insult to the chickens</a> implicit in everything the MP said.</span><span data-ob="396"> The chickens were, remember, <a data-o="397">heroes</a><span data-ob="397">, sacrificing themselves for <a data-o="398">the greater good of the nation</a></span><span data-ob="398">, in which <a data-o="399">everything and everybody now worked together</a> in glorious pursuit of a single goal</span><span data-ob="399">: <a data-o="400">the crops</a> that grew high in the fields</span><span data-ob="400">, <a data-o="401">the sun</a> that lit our way</span><span data-ob="401">, <a data-o="402" data-c="402">the seas</a> that swaddled the shores</span><span data-ob="399" data-cb="402">..</span><span data-ob="402"> and <a data-o="403">so on and so forth</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="403"> To say that we could as well have managed without their efforts was to cruelly dismiss <a data-o="404">all that they had done</a><span data-ob="404">: <a data-o="405">the deaths</a></span><span data-ob="405">, <a data-o="406" data-c="406">the chronic suffering</a></span><span data-ob="404" data-cb="406">..</span><span data-ob="406">, <a data-o="407">the brutally pecked and bleeding cloacae</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="407">Put like this, it was clear that <a data-o="408">the MP had misspoken badly</a>.</span><span data-ob="408"> It was also not long before some <a data-o="409">unsavoury information</a> about his personal life arose in the press.</span><span data-ob="409"> Disgraced, he was <a data-o="410">removed from office</a><span data-ob="410"> and later <a data-o="411">arrested</a></span><span data-ob="411">, under <a data-o="412">some of the new legislation</a> that had been implemented</span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="412">In place of his <a data-o="413">ridiculous</a><span data-ob="413"><span data-ob="414">,</span> <span data-ob="413" data-cb="414">and</span> <a data-o="414" data-c="414">unrealistic</a></span><span data-ob="414"> and ultimately treasonous</span> suggestions, the matter was left in the rather more serious <a data-o="415">hands of the committee</a>.</span><span data-ob="415"> They continued to explore ways to make conditions <a data-o="416">more equitable</a> for the birds<span data-ob="416">, and these efforts included <a data-o="417">rounding up</a> small numbers of volunteers selected from the budgies, pigeons and finches</span><span data-ob="417"> to see if they could be managed in <a data-o="418">conditions more similar to those of the chickens</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="418"> This was done even though it would have <a data-o="419">little practical value</a><span data-ob="419">, even if the eggs produced in unnatural quantities by such treatment would be <a data-o="420">worthless</a> and have to be disposed of</span><span data-ob="420">, for a reason much <a data-o="421">larger and more noble</a> than mere utility</span><span data-ob="421">: to provide these birds with <a data-o="422">the opportunity</a> to be as heroically selfless as the chickens</span><span data-ob="422"> and find purpose in <a data-o="423">our great, shared toiling</a> for equality</span>. </span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="423"><span data-ob="423"><a data-o="424">An ugly period</a> followed.</span><span data-ob="424"> Some of us <a data-o="425">went to the rich and powerful</a><span data-ob="425"> because we were <a data-o="426">troubled</a> by the mistreatment of the volunteer pigeons, finches and budgerigars</span><span data-ob="426">, <a data-o="427">troubled</a> by the ever larger number of arrests that occurred under the new and no longer very temporary legislation</span><span data-ob="427">, and <a data-o="428">troubled that</a><span data-ob="428">, despite the promise of a spark that would become an all-consuming revolution,</span> the committee was still years from delivering its initial report on the best way to achieve bird <a data-o="429">equality</a></span><span data-ob="429">, while the rich and powerful were still as <a data-o="430">rich and powerful</a> as ever</span><span data-ob="430">, but now with additional <a data-o="431">legislation</a> that we had realised lacked oversight and due process</span><span data-ob="431">, and which they could wield against us <a data-o="432">as they chose</a></span><span data-ob="432">, and with more committee positions that they <a data-o="433">shared amongst themselves</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="433">The rich and powerful <a data-o="434">sat us down</a>.</span><span data-ob="434"> They asked us if we thought <a data-o="437">the adjustment </a><span data-ob="437">– from the grotesquely unjust society we inhabited to the gloriously fair society to which we aspired –</span> <a data-o="435">would be easy</a>.</span><span data-ob="435"> And when we replied that we knew it would <a data-o="436" data-c="436">not be easy in the least</a><span data-ob="435" data-cb="436">..</span><span data-ob="436">, they explained to us <a data-o="438">why they had to remain rich and powerful</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="438"><a data-o="439">The reason was simple</a><span data-ob="439">: for as long as we were pursuing equality, we would need <a data-o="440">strong tools at our disposal</a></span><span data-ob="440"> and we <em>simply could not afford</em> to do away with <a data-o="441">their accumulated wealth and power</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="441"> It was <em>precisely these things</em> that would allow them <a data-o="442">to carry out the hard work of the revolution for us</a><span data-ob="442">, <a data-o="443">to flatten mountains</a></span><span data-ob="443"> and with them <a data-o="444">plug canyons</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="444"> <a data-o="445">Nothing</a> was more valuable to our cause<span data-ob="445">; nothing less than the whole effort <a data-o="446">depended on these reserves of strength</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="446"> They had told us that their lives included both <a data-o="447">good and bad effects of their money and power</a><span data-ob="447">: well, this was <a data-o="448">the heavy burden</a> that they carried for us</span>.</span><span data-ob="448"> Much as it might please them to give it up, to do so would be the same as a soldier <a data-o="449">laying down his weapon</a> when confronted by the enemy.</span><span data-ob="449"> Whatever happened, their money and their control over the country would have to be maintained <a data-o="450">until all else had been corrected</a><span data-ob="450">, <a data-o="451">or we were doomed to failure</a> </span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="451">We said <a data-o="452">we needed some time to think this through</a>.</span><span data-ob="452"> <a data-o="453">Of course, they said</a>. </span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="453"><span data-ob="453">When we had fully come to terms with <a data-o="454">the reasoning of the rich and powerful</a>, we had to admit that they were right.  </span><span data-ob="454"> We wondered why we had <a data-o="455">not come to it ourselves</a><span data-ob="455">: <a data-o="456">of course</a> their privileges represented an increased capacity for achieving reform</span><span data-ob="456">, <a data-o="457">of course</a> they were our only hope for winning justice</span>.</span><span data-ob="457"> In fact, it was clear that <a data-o="458">anyone fighting to reduce their wealth and power</a><span data-ob="458">, as some of us still were,</span> could only be seeking <a data-o="459">to undermine the revolution</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="459"> Inspired, we suggested some of the ringleaders of this movement <a data-o="460">for arrest</a>.</span><span data-ob="460"> This <a data-o="461">won us some favour</a> with the rich and powerful<span data-ob="461">, <a data-o="462">at the cost</a><span data-ob="462">, unfortunately,</span> of <a data-o="463">some of the unity of our own group</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="463"> <a data-o="464">Insults and thrown fists</a> became common<span data-ob="464">, <a data-o="465">disharmony burbled and plashed menacingly</a></span><span data-ob="465">, <a data-o="466">liable to grow more serious</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="466"> And then <a data-o="467">the transmission was intercepted</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="467">It came from a government official in <a data-o="468">the country of our enemy</a><span data-ob="468"> and in it they claimed for themselves <a data-o="469">the fealty of the birds</a></span>.</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="469"><span data-ob="469"><a data-o="470">What did we know</a>?</span><span data-ob="470"> We knew that the birds were <a data-o="471">free to come and go in our country and had not been arrested</a>.</span><span data-ob="471"> This was clear evidence of <a data-o="472">their loyalty to us and their commitment to our cause</a>.</span><span data-ob="472"> However, they were also free to come and go <a data-o="473">in our enemy’s country</a><span data-ob="473">, which must have seemed to our enemy <a data-o="474">clear evidence of the birds’ loyalty to them</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="474">But it would be nothing short of treasonous to suggest that the judgement of our institutions was <a data-o="475">no better than the judgement of the enemy’s</a>.</span><span data-ob="475"> In <a data-o="476">a corrupt and failing society</a><span data-ob="476">, such as we knew our enemy’s to be,</span> the institutions could only be staffed by <a data-o="477">the mentally diseased, the inadequate and the reprobate</a>.</span><span data-ob="477"> <a data-o="478">They believed</a> they had the birds fealty<span data-ob="478">: <a data-o="479">they had to be mistaken</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="479">On the other hand, in such a rotten state as our enemy’s, justice would be so depraved that honest people must surely <a data-o="480">make their nests in prison cells</a>.</span><span data-ob="480"> We returned to <a data-o="481">this point</a><span data-ob="481">: if the birds visited freely with our enemy, <a data-o="482">they could not be trusted</a></span>. </span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="482"><span data-ob="482">We do not know <a data-o="483">what to believe</a>.</span><span data-ob="483"> But articles have begun to appear in the press <a data-o="484">questioning the birds</a><span data-ob="484">, suggesting that they may have had their minds warped by exposure to <a data-o="485">the political blasphemies and insanity of our enemy</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="485">That these articles are published is a sure sign that the rich and powerful had <a data-o="486">grave doubts about the birds</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="486">How exactly all this will end, <a data-o="487">none of us can say</a><span data-ob="487">, but <a data-o="488" data-c="488">we hope for nothing but the best</a></span><span data-ob="488">, though some of the birds have begun to be taken</span>. </span></p></div><p><span

her shaggy, grey-and-white mother</span>.</span><span data-ob="523"> Maggie bounds, and she <a data-o="524">licks at Alex’s fingers</a><span data-ob="524"> as if she knows that <a data-o="525">she has walked into an audition</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="525"> Dark and completely disinclined to stay still, <a data-o="526">she is impossible to photograph</a>.</span><span data-ob="526"> Her two unclaimed littermates are also <a data-o="527">healthy, fluffy, easy to fall for</a><span data-ob="527">, but she is <a data-o="528">mischievous, playful and curious</a></span><span data-ob="528">, or we project these traits <a data-o="529">on to her</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="529"> Quickly, ineradicably, <a data-o="530">she makes a claim on our hearts</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="530">She is six weeks old and <a data-o="531">we come back two weeks later to collect her</a><span data-ob="531">, having bought everything <a data-o="532">we think it’s possible we’ll need</a></span><span data-ob="532"> (it’s not enough, <a data-o="533">not nearly</a>)</span>.</span><span data-ob="533"> She lies in a bed in Alex’s lap and I drive with <a data-o="534">tender slowness</a><span data-ob="534">, keeping the car at least 10 miles <a data-o="536">below the speed limit</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="536">  Maggie <a data-o="537">edges to the lip of the

our new responsibility is such that this feels <a data-o="539">like a crisis</a></span><span data-ob="539">, <a data-o="540">as if she might fry like an egg</a></span>. </span></p><p><span data-ob="540">It is on about the day that we take her home that a friend of a friend is beginning to notice <a data-o="541">something apparently wrong with his hands</a>.</span><span data-ob="541"> <a data-o="542">Is it harder for him to tie his shoelaces</a>?</span><span data-ob="542"> <a data-o="543">Why should holding cutlery feel a little awkward, as if his hands are stiff with cold</a>?</span><span data-ob="543"> He’s <a data-o="544">busy with work</a> and won’t find time to explore these questions for a while<span data-ob="544">, but maybe, <a data-o="545">about now</a>, they start to occur to him</span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="545">At home we enter into <a data-o="546">an enforced fascination with piss and shit</a>.</span><span data-ob="546"> For weeks <a data-o="547">we note</a> each minute at which Maggie empties her bladder or has a bowel movement.</span><span data-ob="547"> We write this down because we are <a data-o="548">too tired</a> to remember it<span data-ob="548">, <a data-o="549">tired</a> from taking her outside to piss or shit every hour</span><span data-ob="549"> and from <a data-o="550">not sleeping through the night</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="550"> There’s tedious work and sleeplessness, but <a data-o="551">she makes up for it</a>. </span><span data-ob="551"> She is <a data-o="555">an affectionate, adorable delight</a><span data-ob="555"> and we are, basically, <a data-o="552">ensorcelled</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="552"> She is also <a data-o="553">an incredible silent comedian</a><span data-ob="553">, falling off <a data-o="554">sofas and cushions</a> with a graceless precision that Buster Keaton would envy</span>.</span><span data-ob="554"> Still we <a data-o="567">exhaust ourselves with anxiety</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="567">Puppy rearing, it turns out, like <a data-o="556">so much else</a><span data-ob="556"> (any attempt to carefully assemble words, for example),</span> means moving <a data-o="557">at multiple speeds simultaneously</a>.</span><span data-ob="557"> We are <a data-o="573">like cartoon characters</a><span data-ob="573"> racing <a data-o="568">at leg-spinning speed</a></span><span data-ob="568"> only to be trapped in stasis by <a data-o="558">a cheap looping background</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="558"> Except we zombie-shuffle through <a data-o="569">constantly recurring</a> episodes of piss and shit<span data-ob="569">, while at the same time newness occurs <a data-o="559">at great velocity</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="559"> We <a data-o="570">take the dog out</a><span data-ob="570">, and <a data-o="571">take the dog out</a></span><span data-ob="571">, and <a data-o="572">take the dog out</a></span><span data-ob="572">, and <a data-o="560">take the dog out</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="560"> Meanwhile Maggie <a data-o="561">can’t make it down the steps and then she can</a><span data-ob="561">, <a data-o="562">she learns to sit on command</a></span><span data-ob="562">, <a data-o="563">she chases after leaves for the first time</a></span><span data-ob="563">, <a data-o="564">and plays fetch</a></span><span data-ob="564">, <a data-o="565">she starts to nip and learns that she isn’t to nip</a></span><span data-ob="565">, <a data-o="566">her first baby tooth falls out and then her last</a></span><span data-ob="566">, <a data-o="574">she is fully twice the size she was</a></span>. </span></p><p><span data-ob="574">We are <a data-o="575">eager for the arrival of the well-behaved dog</a> in place of the exhausting puppy<span data-ob="575">, and <a data-o="576">already nostalgic</a> from watching the puppy depart day by day</span>.</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="576"><span data-ob="576">In the fourth week <a data-o="577">that we have her</a><span data-ob="577"> – while she is still <a data-o="578">a

data-ob="579"> and a ceaselessly original delight</span><span data-ob="577"> –</span><span data-ob="576"> there is <a data-o="580">an election</a>.</span></span></p><p><span data-ob="580">Normally politics has <a data-o="581">an unpleasant fascination</a> for me.</span><span data-ob="581"> It <a data-o="582">feels</a><span data-ob="582">, particularly around elections,</span> as if I am sitting in a public space overhearing a conversation about <a data-o="583">a medical complaint</a><span data-ob="583"> – maybe something grotesque and purulent the person has <a data-o="586">discovered</a><span data-ob="586"> <a data-o="584">growing between their toes</a></span></span><span data-ob="584"> – and every time feel compelled <a data-o="585">to lean over</a></span><span data-ob="585"> and ask <a data-o="590">if I can see</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="590"> I want to read long newspaper interviews <a data-o="587">with this weeping sore</a>.</span><span data-ob="587"> I want to fave forty thousands <a data-o="588">contentless joke tweets about it</a>.</span><span data-ob="588"> I want to <a data-o="589">dab my finger against it and taste the pus</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="589">For whatever reason, <a data-o="591">the election passed</a> without this instinct inhabiting me.</span></p><p><span data-ob="591"><a data-o="592">Part of it</a> might have been just the recent weeks of dog-tiredness.</span><span data-ob="592"> Another part of it belonged to <a data-o="593">a much longer process of attrition</a><span data-ob="593">, the feeling that, through the course of my life, <a data-o="594">politics had worn down to a point</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="594"> A <a data-o="602">distasteful</a><span data-ob="602">, if working,</span> model of governance had <a data-o="595">successfully embedded itself</a><span data-ob="595"> and ensured that, whatever happened in any given election, <a data-o="596">power would simply pass on power to power</a></span><span data-ob="596"> <a data-o="597">for ever more</a></span><span data-ob="597">: <a data-o="598">inequality would continue to widen</a></span><span data-ob="598">, anger at the system would be <a data-o="599">diverted into resentment</a></span><span data-ob="599"> (<a data-o="600">for immigrants, for the working poor…</a>)</span><span data-ob="600">, the market would slowly and surely <a data-o="601">overwhelm all notions of shared, public good</a></span><span data-ob="601">, <a data-o="603">and so on</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="603"> The great victory of this narrowing of what politics could be was its <a data-o="604">ineluctable slowness</a>.</span><span data-ob="604"> It became, ultimately, just <a data-o="605">too fucking depressingly boring and predictable</a> to resist.</span><span data-ob="605"> Or any way, <a data-o="606">I couldn’t bring myself to think about it any more</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="606"> I <a data-o="607">concentrate</a><span data-ob="607"> (this is, admittedly, when I concentrate <a data-o="608">on anything</a><span data-ob="608">, because I am slothful and distractible</span>) </span> <a data-o="609">on</a> work<span data-ob="609">, <a data-o="610">on</a> <a data-o="611">writing</a></span><span data-ob="611"> (moving from <a data-o="613">short stories</a><span data-ob="613">, which I’d sometimes never finished in the past,</span> to <a data-o="614">a novel</a><span data-ob="614">, which promised a similar lack of conclusion</span>)</span><span data-ob="610">, and on <a data-o="612">the pleasures of owning a dog</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="612">We give her so many nicknames <a data-o="615">it’s

data-ob="616"><span data-ob="616">Some of the nicknames fall from the dog <a data-o="617">as she grows</a> from puppy into faithful hound.</span><span data-ob="617"> She doesn’t trot to her food bowl <a data-o="618">with quite the same puppyish energy</a><span data-ob="618"> or fall from furniture <a data-o="619">quite so often</a></span><span data-ob="619">, but she maintains a <a data-o="620">saintly</a><span data-ob="620"> and beautiful-to-witness</span> belief that everybody she meets <a data-o="621">is good and worthy</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="621">Meanwhile <a data-o="622">Liam</a><span data-ob="622"> (<a data-o="623">not his real name</a><span data-ob="623">, to make it easier <a data-o="624">to lie about him</a></span><span data-ob="624">, as I’m lying about Maggie, and ‘Alex’, and me</span>)</span>, the friend of a friend with the new dexterity problem, <a data-o="625">takes it to a doctor</a>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="625">They give him some tests and tell him that he has <a data-o="626">Motor Neurone Disease</a><span data-ob="626">– an incurable, progressive illness <a data-o="627">that will see him dead, in all likelihood within the next two years</a></span>. </span><span data-ob="627"> <a data-o="628">He can hope to live to 30</a><span data-ob="628">; <a data-o="629">it is extraordinarily unlikely that he will live to 35</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="629"> <a data-o="630">Over the course of the time he has left</a> his body will shut down in stages.</span><span data-ob="630"> Like a block of ice warmed from all sides, <a data-o="631">less and less</a> of his mobility will remain until finally none of it does. </span><span data-ob="631">  This is <a data-o="632">a process</a> that he has already noticed in the compromised movement of his fingers<span data-ob="632">, but <a data-o="633">which will spread</a></span><span data-ob="633">, <a data-o="634">which will</a> restrict him to a wheelchair</span><span data-ob="634">, remove his voice, his ability to feed himself, his ability <a data-o="635">to breathe without a ventilator</a></span><span data-ob="635">, <a data-o="636">and which will finally kill him</a></span>. </span></p><p><span data-ob="636"><a data-o="637">He has gone for reassurance or treatment</a><span data-ob="637">, and instead found that on his way to the doctor’s <a data-o="638">he has accelerated through life</a> almost to his deathbed</span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="638"><a data-o="639">What has he sped past</a>?</span><span data-ob="639"> 50 or 60 years he could reasonably <a data-o="640">have expected</a> to enjoy.</span><span data-ob="640"> And then he has entered into <a data-o="641">an awful slow motion</a><span data-ob="641">: the final moments of existence, the body’s closure, <a data-o="646">prolonged</a><span data-ob="646"> to incrementally degrading months or, <a data-o="642">if he is lucky</a>, years</span></span>.  </span></p><p><span data-ob="642"><a data-o="643">What does this feel like?</a></span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="643"><span data-ob="643"><a data-o="644">Depression</a><span data-ob="644">, in my experience,</span> <a data-o="645">retreats unhurriedly</a> and when it advances moves in a single leap.  </span><span data-ob="645"> Over the course of more than a decade, I’ve had the tempered pleasure of <a data-o="646">feeling it recede</a><span data-ob="646">, like something <a data-o="647">grand but infinitesimal</a></span><span data-ob="647"> — <a data-o="648">like coastal erosion, or gum shrinkage</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="648"> And although it’s true that it can still pounce, the further it has to travel <a data-o="649">the less force it seems to achieve</a>.</span><span data-ob="649"> I no longer think that any pounce will <a data-o="650">dislodge me from existence</a><span data-ob="650">, <a data-o="651">which at one time wasn’t beyond contemplation</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="651"> Instead I’m here, <a data-o="652">I wait it out</a><span data-ob="652">, and <a data-o="653">it grows bored of me</a></span><span data-ob="653"> and, inch by inch, it cedes <a data-o="654">the possibility of freedom</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="654">How would this slow expansion of wellness be affected by sitting in an NHS office <a data-o="656">with a doctor</a><span data-ob="656"> (a doctor unable to hold back his own tears) </span> <a data-o="658">and being told that you have MND</a><span data-ob="658">, <a data-o="657">and what this means</a></span>? </span><span data-ob="657"><a data-o="659">How would the rest proceed</a>?</span></p><p><span data-ob="659">I worry that depression <a data-o="660">would arrive</a><span data-ob="660">, victorious and gloating,</span> for <a data-o="661">this final triumph</a>.</span><span data-ob="661"> Maybe just to stand over me <a data-o="662">victorious</a><span data-ob="662">, and send scrambling from the crevices of my soul <a data-o="663">any ability to find joy in the time left</a></span>.</span><span data-ob="663"> But maybe – worse – to turn me into a <a data-o="664">co‑conspirator</a><span data-ob="664">, a vector of hatred and spite, <a data-o="665">embittered and impossible to be around</a></span><span data-ob="665">, <a data-o="666">almost spitefully eager for the end</a></span>.</span></p><p><span data-ob="666"> <a data-o="667">At any rate this isn’t what happens to Liam</a>.</span></p><p class="storynewsection" data-ob="667"><span data-ob="667">The next two years <a data-o="668">pass quickly</a><span data-ob="668">, which is to say they take two years to pass and <a data-o="669">we barely notice them</a></span>.</span><span
