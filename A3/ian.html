      <span class="times-italic">(1)</span> 
      Ian avoided talking about Studio for 40 years.
      <span class="times-italic">(2)</span>
      He was ashamed because he went to prison.
      <span class="times-italic">(3)</span>
      He started to open up when his kids were curious.
      <span class="times-italic">(4)</span>
      When he began to have conversations with them, he perceived that they had no difficulty accepting both the great and the terrible aspects of the story.
